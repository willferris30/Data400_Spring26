# Data 400 Mini Project
## Firm characteristics (2024) → stock returns (2025)

# Research question & why it’s tractable

**Question:** Do firm characteristics measured in **2024** help explain differences in stock returns during **2025**?

**Why tractable:**
- Clear unit of analysis: firm (ticker) + annual/price-based outcomes
- Predictors are standard fundamentals / risk measures (value, profitability, leverage, size, volatility)
- Clean time ordering: **2024 predictors → 2025 outcomes** (limits look-ahead bias)

# Data & sample (what’s in the dataset)

.pull-left[
**Universe:** Combined S&P 500 + Russell 2000 constituents

**Key fields:**
- Prices: 2024-01-01, 2024-12-31, 2025-12-31
- Fundamentals (2024): Market cap, P/E, P/B, ROE, ROA, leverage, liquidity, EV/EBITDA
- Classification: GICS Sector

- Bloomberg Terminal in Althouse

# EDA 3 — Size effect (quintile sorts)

.pull-left[

**Approach:** Bucket firms into market-cap quintiles using `ln_mktcap`

**What to look for:**
- Mean vs median differences (outliers vs typical firm)
- Whether the relationship looks monotonic

<div class="speaker-note">
Say: “Small firms can have higher averages because a few names explode; medians tell you what a typical firm did.”

# EDA 4 — Sector return differences

# Model 1 — Baseline regression

.pull-left[
- Volatility (2024) positively associated with 2025 returns (p < 0.01)
- Size (ln mktcap): + & significant
- Leverage (Debt/Equity): - & significant
- R² ≈ 3.8%

- Riskier firms earned higher returns in 2025
- Larger firms outperformed after controlling for other traits
- Higher leverage correlated with weaker forward performance

# Model 2 — Add liquidity + growth

.pull-left[
**Added:** Current ratio (liquidity) & Revenue growth (growth)

- Liquidity (Current Ratio) and Revenue Growth are not significant
- Core signals remain: volatility (+), size (+), leverage (–)
- R² increases slightly (3.8% → 4.8%)
- Adding growth and liquidity does not meaningfully change results
- Risk and capital structure matter more than short-term growth in this sample

# Model 3 — Sector fixed effects

.pull-left[
**Why:** Compare firms against a sector baseline to reduce sector-year noise
**Add:** `C(GICS Sector)` to the regression

- Increase R² to 8.0%
- Volatility (+), size (+), leverage (–) remain significant
- Value (book-to-market) weakens
- Some return variation is clearly sector-driven
- Volatility & Leverage remain important
- The value effect is partially absorbed by industry structure

# Results synthesis (what mattered most)

.pull-left[
**Most consistent correlates in this dataset:**
1) **2024 volatility** → higher 2025 returns (risk rewarded)  
2) **Size (ln mktcap)** → positive association in this sample  
3) **Leverage (Debt/Equity)** → negative association  
4) **Value (book-to-market)** shows in baseline, weaker once sector controls enter

# Implications for stakeholders (who should care?)

**Investors**
- Outliers dominate means → diversification matters
- Sector-neutral screens help avoid “sector-year” confusion
- Leverage exposure may be a hidden risk

**Corporate leaders**
- Higher leverage correlates with weaker forward outcomes here
- Capital structure affects resilience and investor perception

**Risk teams**
- Volatility signal suggests risk-taking was rewarded in 2025
- Stress-test—these relationships can flip across regimes

# Ethical, legal, societal implications

.pull-left[

### Promotes Transparent Investing
- Links fundamentals to outcomes  
- Reduces speculation and hype  

### Encourages Responsible Risk
- Leverage associated with weaker returns  
- Supports sustainable balance sheets  

]

.pull-right[

### Enables Fair Comparisons
- Sector controls prevent misleading conclusions  

### Legal & Professional Responsibility
- Proper Bloomberg data use  
- No look-ahead bias  
- Findings presented as associations, not guarantees

# Final takeaway

<div class="big-quote">
In this dataset, the most stable 2024 correlates of 2025 returns were<br/>
<b>volatility</b>, <b>size</b>, and <b>leverage</b> — and <b>sector context</b> changed interpretation.
