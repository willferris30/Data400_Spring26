My analysis will discover whether increased inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are associated with higher short-term volatility in the underlying stocks due to the mechanical trading behavior of passive investment strategies.

This research idea requires data on ETF inflows, stock prices, and stock return volatility. ETF flow data is publicly disclosed and made available such as the changes in shares outstanding or trading volume reported by ETF providers and financial data platforms. Daily stock price data for the underlying holdings is also accessible through a variety of financial databases such as Yahoo Finance or Stock Analysis (which we used in Empirical Finance). I will have to check which site is best in terms of accessibility and retrievability, but these sources are well-documented, publicly available, and can be merged using ticker symbols and dates.

The data will be retrieved using Python by accessing publicly available ETF and stock market data through APIs and downloadable CSV files. Stock price data for individual securities will be collected programmatically using Python libraries like yfinance. The ETF information such as shares outstanding, trading volume, and holdings will be obtained from official ETF provider websites such as iShares, SPDR, or Vanguard who provide downloadable holdings files with information on asset weighting, tickers, etc. The data will be cleaned, merged, and organized using pandas and numpy to construct a panel dataset indexed by ticker symbols and dates to ensure reproducibility and efficient handling of time-series financial data.
	
The primary model will be a linear regression that will connect stock-level volatility to ETF inflows while controlling for basic firm characteristics like market capitalization and overall market volatility. Volatility is measured through standard deviations of returns and ETF inflows will likely be lagged to avoid interpretation issues due to time periods. I could also use a machine learning model to predict volatility and compare its performance to the linear specification.
	
The findings are relevant to investors, portfolio managers, and financial regulators who are interested in understanding how passive investment flows affect market behavior. My inspiration for this project was an argumentative article I read discussing whether the rising popularity of ETFs has overvalued underlying stocks thus the market doesn’t reflect true fundamental valuations. These related topics are certainly widely in the news and relevant to modern day investing. If ETF inflows are associated with higher short-term volatility, this may increase trading risk for investors, complicate portfolio risk management for asset managers, and raise concerns for regulators about market stability and price discovery within financial markets that are being increasingly dominated by passive investment strategies.

The broader societal value is that understanding whether ETF inflows are linked to short-term volatility can help clarify how modern passive investing affects market stability and household financial security since most retirement accounts and long-term savings are increasingly invested through ETFs. If flow-driven volatility contributes to sharper short-term price swings, the costs are not evenly shared meaning less sophisticated investors and those forced to trade during downturns may face higher prices and larger risk while large institutions position themselves to profit from the volatility. By making those market dynamics more transparent, the research can support more informed risk disclosure, better investor education, and display evidence to regulators and market designers about how they can reduce fragility without restricting access to low-cost investing.
